ping -I wg0 10.90.42.1

10.90.42.1 is pinging the outside device in the net 131.174.16.146 (see eth1)
But actually we are getting the requests on our Kali VM.
We need to forward them in the routing table to the outside world and then get them back 
(but getting back is done automatically, because of the src address of the netsec-2 - we just need to forward it?)

sudo iptables -t nat -L


root@netsec-kali:~# iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE

This rule allowed pings to leave our NAT.
