SSLStrip is a type of MITM attack that forces a victim's browser into communicating with an adversary in plain-text 
over HTTP, and the adversary proxies the modified content from an HTTPS server. 
To do this, SSLStrip is "stripping" https:// URLs and turning them into http:// URLs.

It receives the traffic via firewall, because we gave it an explicit rule to traffic all HTTPS traffic going to the port 
80 to our desired port (also IP forwarding needed to be enabled before).

I would say it rewrites the paket because it uses another protocol - HTTPS not HTTP.
I mean the firewall will rewrite the destination port so, yes, in this sense it gets rewritten. 

SSLstrip downgrades HTTPS to HTTP via redirection mappings.
