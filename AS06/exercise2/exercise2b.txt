Arpspoof the other host:
sudo arpspoof -i eth1 172.21.152.101

Arpspoofing gateway:
sudo arpspoof -i eth1 172.21.152.1

After arpspoofing both host and gateway I saw DNS requests to the follwing sites to the google DNS server (1.1.1.1.)
I believe (I also use that as mz backup DNS server...):
vortex.data.microsoft.com and other subdomains: 
asimov.data.microsoft.com 
geo.data.microsoft.com 
db5.data.microsoft.com 

cs.ru.nl


I saved exercise in .pcapng because there was no option for .cap
I also included the arp replies but one can simply filter them using !arp flag.
I also had to "unlock" the file for reading using command:
sudo chmod +r exercise2b.pcapng
