A countermeasure I found would be:
HSTS is an HTTP security mechanism that allows web sites to declare themselves as accessible only via secure connections
and for users to direct user agents (UAs), or your browser, to interact with web sites only over a secure connection.

In practice you can see that very often, when you can not acces a certain site if you use http over https.
Sometimes you get a notification/warning that the site is not secure an other times the site just won't load.
If the website is configured properly, you can even be redirected from http to https.

In short, it FORCES HTTPS.
