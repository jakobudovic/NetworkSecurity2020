The actual data, we get back is LARGER than the data_length variable we get from parse_udp() function.

The difference is 8 Bytes always, which we can also see in the wireshark, see screenshot - length.png.
We can see there, that Data is 7B long but lenght that we see (also highlighted) on the picture
is 15B. Those 8B of difference are meant for the header of the UDP payload. 
Together they combine in 15B.

"â€©Length is the length in octets of this user datagram including this
header and the data. (This means the minimum value of the length is
eight.)"
- source: RFC (https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc768.txt)

Why is minimum value 8B? Because we could send 0B of data but we should still include the header
of the UDP datagram, consisting of Source and destination ports, Length and checkum.
