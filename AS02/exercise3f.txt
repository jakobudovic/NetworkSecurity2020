I was scrolling through the traffic between 
Allnet_0c:f7:8c and Tp-LinkT_d7:70:67 and saw some big chunks of UDP packets.
After inspecting the contents of them I realised they include an interesting text:

"Insert your student numbers in the following places. Do not change thepacket length. 
Leave superfluous letters as padding..Student 1:XXXXXXXXXXXX.Student 2: YYYYYYYYYYYY.Student 3:ZZZZZZZZZZZZ."
