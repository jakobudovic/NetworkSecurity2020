$ sudo arpspoof -i eth1 172.21.152.1

After opening statistic > endpoints, I could see different node on the LAN.
There were 4 of them:
08:00:27:62:02:ee (PcsCompu_62:02:ee)
08:00:27:66:17:ab (PcsCompu_66:17:ab)
08:00:27:df:09:84 (PcsCompu_df:09:84)
ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff (broadcast)

We have 3 actual endpoints and 1 broadcast value.

After inspecting the conversations pannel, I noticed this:
PcsCompu_62:02:ee -> PcsCompu_df:09:84
PcsCompu_66:17:ab -> PcsCompu_df:09:84
PcsCompu_62:02:ee -> broadcast
PcsCompu_66:17:ab -> broadcast
PcsCompu_df:09:84 -> broadcast

I would say that we have 3 devices on this network.
PcsCompu_62:02:ee, PcsCompu_66:17:ab and PcsCompu_df:09:84.
Each conversation is done either to a broadcast address or to a device PcsCompu_df:09:84.
That's why I think the host we're redirecting packets to is PcsCompu_df:09:84


b)
Arpspoof intercepts packets on a switched LAN.
It redirects packets from a target host(s) on the LAN to another host, by forging ARP replies.
Sniffing traffic on a switch.
Kernel IP forwarding must be turned ON beforehand.

sudo arpspoof -i eth1 172.21.152.1

sudo - root rights
-i - interface mode, specify the interface to use
eth1 - interface we use
172.21.152.1 - this is the host we wish to intercept packets for (usually it's the local gateway)

Because we didn't use the -t tag to specify a particular host to ARP poison, all hosts on the LAN are targets.

c) 
because we would need to specify the "-r" flag/option in order to poison bost hosts, to capture the 
traffic in BOTH directions.
But if we wanted to use this option, we would also need to explicitlz set up the target with "-t" option.

d)
After looking into converstions, I am able to see 1 TCP conversation going from 
from 172.21.152.44 to 172.21.152.1 (gateway). 
I am unable to see what's on the other side of the gateway. 
In the IPv4 pannel I can see arriving packets FROM the gateway to our LAN, to the addresses 
172.21.152.44 and 172.21.152.79, which are in the same network.
Those same addresses/devices are sending their packets to the gateway, meaning, they perform communication with devices in another network.
We don't see the final destination address (yet).
