Lecture about DNS amplification: 58:30

LAN network
203.0.113.0/24

gateway’s internal IP address:
203.0.113.1

gateway’s external IP address:
198.51.100.78

We need to filter spoofed IP addresses ("ingres and an egress filtering")
So I will only allow outgoing traffic for the IPs that I already know belong to our LAN.
Hmm since I got my address space given already, which is 203.0.113.0/24, I can only allow outgoing traffic for them.
Since DNS (usually) uses UDP as its protocol, I could simply block all UDP outgoing traffic by default and then add a rule 
which allows our LAN addresses to still send the requests out.
But if i block all outgoing traffic, my LAN would be cut out the net.
Therefore I will just try to block all udp outgoing traffic for the IPs NOT matching the 203.0.113.0/24

TABLE (filter):
*filter
:INPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
:FORWARD ACCEPT [0:0]
:OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
-A OUTPUT -p udp -s ! 203.0.113.0/24 -d 203.0.113.1 --ctstate NEW, ESTABLISHED, RELATED -j REJECT 

I don't think --cstate part is neccessary here since since we target all of them therfore we don't need to specify that.
I was googling how I could match all other IPs except the 203.0.113.0/24 but I couldn't find anzthing besides putting "!"
in front.
