NAT RFC: http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5508.txt

ICMP Error messages provide signaling for IP.
All ICMP Error messages are characterized by the fact that they
embed the original datagram that triggered the ICMP Error message.
The original datagram embedded within the ICMP Error payload is
also referred to as the "Embedded packet" throughout the document.
Unlike ICMP Query messages, ICMP Error messages do not have a Query
Id in the ICMP header.

Basically error message is just the same message that triggered the error, stored in another header.

a)



b)
When an ICMP Error packet is received, if the
ICMP checksum fails to validate, the NAT SHOULD silently drop the
ICMP Error packet.  This is because NAT uses the embedded IP and
transport headers for forwarding and translating the ICMP Error
message (described in Section 4.2).  When the ICMP checksum is
invalid, the embedded IP and transport headers, which are covered by
the ICMP checksum, are also suspect.
