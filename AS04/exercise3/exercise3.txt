a)
All the traffic get's picked up by the VPN rules 1 and 2. It can't even reach the rule 7.
It's the "trick" of the vpn.


b)

10.0.0.0/8
172.16.0.0/12
and
192.168.0.0/16

are reserved ip addresses for local usage. 
A user can connect local devices on them and communicate through it.
For the VPN it would be useful because you can run a server for example, where you keep your storage.
Like a personal cloud storage.

The route redirects these reserved IP addresses to the router gateway (145.116.128.1), where it is then decided, if the traffic goes 
to another local device or out to the internet, through the interface wlp3s0.


c)
my IP address is 145.116.128.31/22
VPN runs on a machine with IP address 198.51.100.42
VPN uses the network 10.50.9.0/24

3. 10.50.9.0/24 dev tap0 proto kernel scope link src 10.50.9.60
4. 10.0.0.0/8 via 145.116.128.1 dev wlp3s0
5. 172.16.0.0/12 via 145.116.128.1 dev wlp3s0
6. 192.168.0.0/16 via 145.116.128.1 dev wlp3s0

rule 3 is just more specific than rule 4. 
IT's the vpn traffic and scope link src 10.50.9.60 ip ist our ip inside the vpn.


d)
8. 131.174.117.20 via 145.116.128.1 dev wlp3s0
We reach our dhcp server via our gateway.

If it's not present, we don't get service from our dhcp server.

e)
10. 198.51.100.42 via 145.116.128.1 dev wlp3s0
It routes our VPN "requests" via our router gateway.
Without it, we wouldn't be able to reach our VPN network.

f)
No it does not get tunneled since it's running on the same server, uses same ip -> the rule 10 applies.
It gets routed through the router gateway.
