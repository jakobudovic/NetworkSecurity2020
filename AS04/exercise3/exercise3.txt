a)
The traffic goes to default which is 0.0.0.0/0.

It's the only option that is more "generic" than 1,2 and 7.

b)

10.0.0.0/8
172.16.0.0/12
and
192.168.0.0/16

are reserved ip addresses for local usage. 
A user can connect local devices on them and communicate through it.
For the VPN it would be useful because you can run a server for example, where you keep your storage.
Like a personal cloud storage.

That way, you can connect through VPN to your local area network and have access to all of them devices.

The route redirects these reserved IP addresses to the router gateway (145.116.128.1), where it is then decided, if the traffic goes 
to another local device or out to the internet.

c)
my IP address is 145.116.128.31/22
VPN runs on a machine with IP address 198.51.100.42
VPN uses the network 10.50.9.0/24

3. 10.50.9.0/24 dev tap0 proto kernel scope link src 10.50.9.60
4. 10.0.0.0/8 via 145.116.128.1 dev wlp3s0
5. 172.16.0.0/12 via 145.116.128.1 dev wlp3s0
6. 192.168.0.0/16 via 145.116.128.1 dev wlp3s0

Since 4,5 and 6 redirect traffic from their ips to the gateway 145.116.128.1, the rule 3 takes care of further processing.
It means that whatever is in the scope of 10.50.9.60 
that within the network segment of the device communication is allowed through this link.

The ip of the interface tap0 is 10.50.9.60 so everything with a src address like this _____...

d)
8. 131.174.117.20 via 145.116.128.1 dev wlp3s0
It redirects traffic from 131.174.117.20 to 145.116.128.1 (gateway)
So from our dhcp server to our gateway.

If it's not present, we don't get service from our dhcp server but we probably get it from someone else..

e)
10. 198.51.100.42 via 145.116.128.1 dev wlp3s0
It routes our VPN via our router gateway.
Without it, the VPN would be cut from the outside web.

f)
Connecting on the same machine where the VPN is running means we ...
